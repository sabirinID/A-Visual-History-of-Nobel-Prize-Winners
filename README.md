# A Visual History of Nobel Prize Winners

## Project Description
The Nobel Prize, one of the world's most renowned scientific awards, is presented annually to scientists and scholars in the fields of chemistry, literature, physics, medicine, economics, and peace. The award's history dates back to 1901. Initially, it was Eurocentric and male-focused, but today it is unbiased.

In this project, I'll investigate patterns and trends among Nobel Prize winners over the past 100 years. We will explore questions such as: What characteristics do the prize winners share? Which country has the most recipients? Has anyone received the award more than once?

The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/nobelfoundation/nobel-laureates) used in this project is from The Nobel Foundation on Kaggle.
